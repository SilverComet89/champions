# Champions example theme

This is an example using Twenty Nineteen as a framework.

## Installation

Copy the folder in to the website installation you own.

## Customisation

There are examples of customisation within the theme customise options, default values have been created for these. You do not need to add any content to get the page in to a working state.

## Responsiveness

The site is responsive down to 600px which is the base Wordpress dimensions, I can do lower if required.

## Wordpress integration

Where possible I've tried to make sure that I use the Wordpress functionality, for example the menus are all driven by the Wordpress menu creator, the CSS is all generated by SCSS being compiled through NPM. Colours are all defined within the theme customisation and the image is done through the customisation menu.

## Issues

Any issues with installation please don't hesitate to get in touch, I'm more than happy to help.
